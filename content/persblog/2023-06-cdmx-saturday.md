I am on a work trip to Mexico City. One thing we've learned about Malone's proximity to Montr√©al is that there seem to be (n=2 so far) many affordable non-stop flights to international destinations. Departure times have been good, too. The drive to get to YUL is a bit tricky, but Stella was able to do it on the first attempt with no wrong turns. The airport itself feels very easy to get from departures curb to the international zone. Very nice!

The rest of the trip was smooth sailing: I had an empty seat next to me on the flight, customs was fast and easy, taxi to my airbnb was OK, and the airbnb is very nice. So far only had a few minors challenges with the ATM - they insert cards sideways here and one food order we didn't quite understand.

Anyway, it's neat. These blog posts are mostly a record for me to go back and remember what year/month I traveled to a given place, so future me, this is when I went to Mexico City on a work trip.

I guess for the record let me slip into my mind's native bullet list format and jot down what we did yesterday:

* Hung out with Jon and got some nachos and beer while Nat checked into his airbnb directly across from the WeWork
* Chatted a bit about WeWork and Adam Neumann's bizarreness and whether Focus Retreat Center is "WeLive but even more absurd/hardcore" or "WeLive but more down to earth and pragmatic" LOL.
* Walked around a lot (Roma Norte and La Condesa mostly I think)
* Heard the story of how Jon ended up living here
* Got dinner tacos at Salon Rio
  * Were a bit rushed trying to make a 7:45 reservation at a very fancy cocktail spot called Liqueria Limantor which we eventually were 30 minutes late too and they could not accommodate us
* Got churros and a chocolate malteada as a night cap at Churreria El Moro

T-Mobile gives me enough international mobile data for this trip to be fine. There's Uber but sadly no Lyft.
