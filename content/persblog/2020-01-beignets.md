Friday I took a day off work and Stella and I took the streetcar down toward the quarter. We did the bus detour then walked along the riverfront path. We found some beignets at the end of the french market and gobbled them down with some coffee. We walked quite a ways around the quarter and visited all the magick, voodoo, and hex shops. We had a fairly miserable lunch at a cafe and then got some bike share bikes and rode home via the Lafitte Greenway.

After a long nap, we got some Whole Foods salads for dinner and watched some Legion. We walked a mile or so west to Angelo Bracato's ice cream shop, which is apparently a major attraction and in business since 1905. There was a uniformed and armed police officer stationed there and as we arrived they were at capacity so he told us we needed to wait outside until some people left. Stella got cumquat sherbert and I got a delicious fresh cannoli and gelato. It was heavely and we ended up going back the next night as well.
