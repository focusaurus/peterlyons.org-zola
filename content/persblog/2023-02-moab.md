From Grand Junction, we drove west to Moab to spend a few days with Clarice and Jim. I had been to Fruita, but never made it all the way to Moab before. It was cool to see those rock formations and hike around a bit. I also learned cribbage which was on my list for this trip. After just a few days, we began the final big multi-day drive heading for Chattanooga, TN.
