Last night Michale and I had fun getting dressed up and going dancing at the Denver Decompression. Decompression is a post-Burning-Man party to help people ease back into the "default world" and also to raise funds for the regional burn Apogea. We spent most of the morning hitting costume stores and thrift stores for our get-ups. I got a funny 1970s looking woman's one piece jumpsuit/Bruce Lee track suit type thing that fit perfectly for $10.
