Yesterday I drove 20 miles north from Bend to Smith Rock, the birthplace of modern American sport climbing. The rock formations and views are stunning. I saw some cool rock climbing going on as well. I'll post a few pictures here. Lots more (I filled up my camera) {{ album(dirname="bend_2008_part_2", id="72157702638665112", text="on my web site") }}.
