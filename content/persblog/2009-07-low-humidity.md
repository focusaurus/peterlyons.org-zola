It's 90 degrees here today and I'm still pretty comfortable. I _might_ bust out the A/C. It's pretty nice. When it's 90 in Jersey you are soaked in sweat in 10 minutes if you walk outside. Sadly some wrist pain is coming back again that I have gotten in the past when working at a desk that is too high. I'm taking some restorative measures, but I'll still have to wait a while for my [GeekDesk](http://www.geekdesk.com) to arrive.
