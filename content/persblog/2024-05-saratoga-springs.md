I recently took a little mini-workation to Saratoga Springs, NY. It's a fancy town with lots of nice parks and amenities. Here's some stuff I found:

- Several nice bars and restaurants, especially seneca was amazing
- Plenty of coffee shops. I prefer the chiller vibe at Whitman Brewing Company to Common Grounds which is a bit overwhelming.
- Plenty of ice cream including Kilwins, Ben & Jerry's, a gelato shop, and a candy shop
- 2 coworking spaces
- a no-frills diner
- tasty taco joint

The 2 coworking spaces, diner, and gelato shop are all clustered in the same block which is great.

I rode the bike trail in nearby Colonie which is lovely. There's another rail trail in Saratoga I hope to ride a bit today after work before heading back home.
