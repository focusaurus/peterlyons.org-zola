Monday we slept late and then walked over to Parkway Bakery. We kind of had our minds set on coffee shop and baked goods but this is a spot famous for Poboys so we skipped it and walked over to Fair Grinds coffee shop. We hung around and I computered a bit. Then we walked up to City Park and briefly across a corner before stopping to eat at Mo Pho. Stella had a bowl of pho which was perfect for a cold day. I had a pork belly bowl that was completely delicious and full of fresh herbs.

Back home I did some laundry and got caught up on blog posts. I'm hoping to maybe head over to 30/90 tonight where there might be a funk jam.
