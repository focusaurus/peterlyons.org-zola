OK, I've finally caught up on posting photos.

First, from the Romania trip, I only posted selected photos to this blog. For all of them see {{ album(dirname="romania_2007", id="72157702643543142", text="my photos from Romania") }}.

Then, photos from {{ album(dirname="halloween_2007", id="72157702643538642", text="Thorp's Halloween pumpkin carving party") }}.

A few shots from my {{ album(dirname="cross_country_drive_2007", id="72157704503508131", text="cross country road trip") }}.

And the first bunch of photos from {{ album(dirname="santa_fe_2007", id="72157688966187903", text="my stay in Santa Fe.") }}

Today I went to a rock climbing contest (amateur - just for fun) at the Santa Fe Climbing Club and watched for a while.  Then I visited the [Museum of International Folk Art](http://www.internationalfolkart.org/), which had a very cool exhibit of quilts from [Gee's Bend](http://www.quiltsofgeesbend.com/), Alabama.  Then I did another walk around the main square.
