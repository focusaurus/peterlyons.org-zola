I'm back from a very fun family reunion on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. We played lots of tennis, went swimming in the ocean, played catch on the beach, and rode our rental cruiser bikers around. The golfers golfed in the morning and evenings we enjoyed yummy home cooking and drinks. The title of this post is a quote from one of my cousins shouted during some horsing around in the ocean.
