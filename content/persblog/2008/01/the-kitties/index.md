I'm all settled in here in Boulder now.  The cats are friendly and funny.

Here's the house I rented:

I took off Friday to go skiing at Winter Park with the whole crew: Les, Anne, Elise, and Lewis.  It was overcast in the morning but sunny and nice in the afternoon.

Afterward Bill made us another delicious dinner.  Saturday I had lunch downtown in the Pearl St pedestrian mall area.  It was unseasonably warm - 60 degrees, which was nice.  Today I went again to the Boulder Rock Gym and did some nice climbing and exercising.  It's a really nice big gym.

Tonight Nancy made us a nice chicken salad and we watched Eastern Promises.
