On the drive from Moab to Chattanooga, we stopped near Albuquerque and got some awesome ice cream bars from Paleta Bar. Next stop was Weatherford, OK I think. I think we did one more stop too but I don't recall exactly where. Maybe West Memphis or something. But we arrived in Chattanooga and got settled into our airbnb. I got a membership at Synergy Climbing and Ninja which was a cool bouldering gym not too far from our airbnb. Our place had 2 bedrooms so I was able to work from the spare instead of a coworking space, which was nice.

The weather was much warmer than Moab, but still had the feeling of autumn coolness. Daily highs were 40s or 50s and we had a fair amount of rain. Our visit was two full weeks so we were able to tour around a bit. We enjoyed the Hunter Art Museum and discount day at the arcade/pinball joint.

We had lunch with someone I knew from the Boulder tech scene who had moved from Boulder to Chattanooga a few years ago. It was fun to get their take on the city and especially the comparison coming from Boulder. We also toured the local maker space. I was hoping to give a presentation about the squeezebox keyboard but the "meeting" had no leadership so never really occurred in any meaningful sense of the word.
