On Tuesday I again worked from my airbnb. In the evening I met Luke Palmer, my old friend who used to live in Boulder and played with me in The Afronauts down at the Hi Ho Lounge. Helen Gillet was playing with an experimental band that night. The keyboard player brought an ironing board to use as a stand for his computer and parts of his rig. I felt like that deserve's respect. It was good to catch up with Luke who seems to like it here and is playing a lot of music.
