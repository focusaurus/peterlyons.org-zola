After Tazewell we drove 6 hours to Manning, SC to visit my friend Jamie Sue. I hadn't seen her since she came to a family reunion with the Pizzi/Lyons family in Hilton Head, SC way back in 2009. We had a lot to catch up on and she's been very busy doing her thing. They have a rental property just next door to their house where we could stay. It is way too much space for just the two of us but a very nice treat after spending many weeks in spare bedrooms visiting family and friends this winter. I'm working doing business development for Focus Retreat Center and there's a nice office set up here I can use.

The first evening Heow cooked us personal pizzas in their outdoor kitchen/dining space. They have an Uni oven that gets 1000F and cooks the pizza in 1 minute! It was delicious and fun to do.

Since they are huge DIY folks, we asked if Stella could help with any projects, and they obliged. So today Stella got a lesson in operating their tractor with bucket and moved a bunch of mulch around their garden beds.
