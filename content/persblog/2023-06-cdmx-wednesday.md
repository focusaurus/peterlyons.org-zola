Wednesday morning I set up shop at a coffee shop called Blend Station before heading to WeWork. To try to get my digestion back into an OK place I got pizza for lunch while the group went for more tacos and Mr. Bianco burgers. After work we went to a speakeasy called Hanky Panky (I think) for some fancy cocktails. Then we went to a very swank restaurant way on the 56th floor of the Ritz Carlton called Ling Ling. Monica joined us again here. It was a slow fancy meal and we were there from 7:30 to 11pm before heading home.
