For a while it seems my anti-spam system for blog comments was misconfigured and holding comments in a quarantine without telling me. This has been corrected. All comments that were trapped in the void are now posted live on the site. The anti-spam setup has been fixed so this shouldn't happen again. No comments that were submitted have been lost. Sorry for that technical glitch. Ditto applies to my professional blog.
