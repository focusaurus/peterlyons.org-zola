OK, I've finally caught up on posting photos.

First, from the Romania trip.

Today I went to a rock climbing contest (amateur - just for fun) at the Santa Fe Climbing Club and watched for a while.  Then I visited the [Museum of International Folk Art](http://www.internationalfolkart.org/), which had a very cool exhibit of quilts from [Gee's Bend](http://www.quiltsofgeesbend.com/), Alabama.  Then I did another walk around the main square.
