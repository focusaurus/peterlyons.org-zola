After two weeks in Chattanooga, we drove to the NE corner of the state to visit extended family in Tazewell, TN. They live nestled within a big 160 acre property that houses the Well Being Retreat Center. Their cabin has a nice apartment on the lower level where we could stay. We got to see their lovely property which sits along the river and is surrounded by forested mountains. They have an awesome wood shop where Hal makes amazing artisanal furniture with hand tools that is museum quality beautiful work. Stella and Joan connected well and we all had a good time. We got a tour of Well Being Retreat Center and a chance to chat with their founders and staff. It's a really impressive facility with many buildings: big conference center, pavilion, standalone cabins, tiny houses, cabinettes, lean-tos, etc. The property is amazing and the road within the property they cleared and built themselves. It was a great opportunity for us to talk shop with them and they were very gracious.

Hal said he has taught woodworking courses in his shop so we mentioned we'd love to do that next winter. We'll see.
