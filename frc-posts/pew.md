Stella heard about a big garage sale going on this weekend and went to check it out with Logan and Jim. It turned out to be a massive lot of stuff. This couple has been developing real estate properties in the area for 30 years including both residential and commercial sites. They accumulated a massive horde of stuff/junk over the years when tenants leave stuff and so on. They had it stacked up in three huge garage warehouses. Space heaters, washers, dryers, chairs, tables, couches, shelving, etc etc.

I didn't go with them on the first day of the sale. I was in the dining room when they came back in from the porch entrance and Stella was directing some folks who were delivering some enormous item. As they brought it into the room I was stunned and blurted out "Is that a freaking church pew?" and Stella smiled back "yup, it's a beaut".

So these dudes carry in a solid wood church pew with a gorgeous arched shape and completely massive end posts. It seats neatly in one corner of the dining room. Stella plans to set several cafe tables in front of it and have it be a spot for 2-top coffee chats and snacking.

She paid $200 for it including delivery. It's pretty sweet.
