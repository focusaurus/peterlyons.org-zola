On Thursday July 1, Stella and I went to walk the property looking for signs of an underground oil storage tank near the perimeter of the buildings. We had been learning about them online so we had a better idea of what the fill pipe and vent pipe might look like and where they were likely to be in relationship to the buildings. We also planned to just walk a grid across the whole property looking for utility boxes and other weird things we may not have seen in prior visits.

In the front lawn there was a roughly 2' wooden cube covering a cast iron pipe jutting out vertically from the ground. I wasn't sure exactly what this was, but I took some pictures so I could post to the /r/whatisthisthing subreddit.

We walked the perimeter of the buildings checking for more broken basement windows, where utility lines entered the building, etc. There's old telephone wire strung around the outside of the main building, power, cable, etc. Around by the ramp to the side porch, there's a small atrium formed by the main building, the hallway connector building, the rear building, and the wheelchair ramp. To get in there you need to either duck under the ramp or squeeze along the narrow space between the ramp and the main building.

We went in there which I don't think we had done on prior visits and there it was plain as day. An oil tank fill valve sticking up out of the ground about 6 inches with the acronym "SOCONY" on it for Standard Oil Company of New York. Cue the Fuuuuuuuu....dge scene from A Christmas Story. This was one of our worst fears as when people talk about this they portray it like it's finding an unspent nuclear warhead on your property.

So this triggered a flood of questions and anxiety and the next several days all our free time was spent doing web research and calling engineering companies to understand the options to remediate. The tank was close to the foundation of both buildings so there was some writing online saying removing the tank might destabilize the soil and foundation and so in that case they drain the tank but fill it with sand in place and close it off. In other cases, they fully excavate and remove the tank entirely.

As it went from very likely to certain that this was in fact an underground storage tank, we fired up the lawyers and they began exchanging letters about whether this was going to kill the deal altogether, and if not what the process would be to get this remediated. As The Dude would say: "That's a bummer, man."

Stella and I were then in a tiny airbnb apartment in downtown Malone. Mailchimp was closed that week for extra pandemic time off. My hope was to spend that week on renovating the building, but instead we were figuring out if the deal was dead, would the seller be responsible for removing the tank, was it sufficient cause for us to cancel the purchase contract and walk away, and if it came to that, what we were going to do with our lives now. Would we move back to CO? Would we stay in NY in temporary housing until our October retreat event?

It was a sucky week. Basically nothing to do but anxious research and a whole lot of waiting around.

The following week we had a family reunion vacation in Old Forge and by that time we were in the mindset of walking away from the deal and had instructed our attorney to get us out of the contract and get our deposit back. We broke the news to family and took most of the vacation to just reel from the shock. We also now officially had no housing plan from mid-July to mid-October so after a few days mourning we had to start looking into airbnbs and short term rentals for that time frame. What we were going to do after the October retreat was still a totally blank slate at this point.

Toward the end of the vacation week, negotiations seemed like the seller was going to make it difficult for us to walk away from the contract. Unfortunately as written we didn't have good date deadlines, at least not anymore as we'd blown way past our initial target dates for inspection and closing several times already. We got into a grey area with half-executed addendums and starting with a realtor contract in the first place. Lesson learned: don't use realtor contracts. Get a contract you understand and like from an attorney and have specific deadlines for each item in the contract and specific recourses for when those deadlines are missed.

So in consultation with our attorney we decided to give them an aggressive deadline to have the underground storage tank (UST in legislative documentation) fully remediated and removed and a clean soil analysis in hand. If they could deliver that by the following Friday, we'd proceed to closing, but if they missed that deadline, we were walking away under the "time is of the essence" precedent.

So we waited out another week fully assuming there wasn't an ice cube's chance in hell they'd make the deadline. But to our surprise, as the deadline approached, they said they were going to make it and that the DEC would be onsite Friday morning overseeing an environmental company draining, excavating, and removing the tank.

We got a text message from Deacon Brent mid-morning confirming that crews and equipment were on site as planned and things appeared to be being done by the book.

So now we had to again shift our thinking back to maybe this place was going to be ours after all.
