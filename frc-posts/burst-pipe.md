In the last week in July, Stella met with a tech from the Village water department to turn water to the building's residential plumbing back on at the valve below the street out front. Once on they felt bold enough to start filling the pipes and I guess turned the valve into the interior plumbing fully open.

On the first floor they found a big leak and a bunch of water rained down from the drop ceiling in the back entryway. So they closed the valve again until we could address the leak. Stella made an appointment for me to meet with Louie the Plumber the next week on Tuesday when I would be back from our CO trip and she would be driving the van from CO to NY. Bear in mind we still hadn't closed on the property at this point.

I called Louie Monday evening to remind him of our appointment as he had requested and then met him at the property on Tuesday morning. He showed up not in a service van, but an early model Subaru wagon. I got a bit of chit-chat about how contractors are all busy and "nobody wants to do any work" which is a refrain we heard all over the place from the supermarket to the barber and elsewhere. We went in and I showed him the basement. He took one look at the fire suppression system and remarked "this thing is an antique!". I pointed out where the leak had been visible on the first floor. It was right outside room 3 and he said "This was my mother's room. I swore to myself I'd never set foot back in this room". Uh, sorry, I guess.

So when I asked him if he would be able to help us with the plumbing, he consulted the Malone Contractor Standard Excuse Playbook and claimed to be too busy for a job this big and refered me to "Dan the Plumber, he's your guy" and promptly pulled away in his Subaru wagon.

I called Dan and gave him an overview and he bailed without even coming to the property to look. So we accepted that we'd have to do more of this on our own when Stella got back to NY.

So we got up into the drop ceiling and started looking for leaks. After a while I noticed the light bouncing off a small drop of water hanging down from a copper pipe. I think we turned the water on briefly again and were able to confirm that was the spot. Stella had a mirror on an antenna kind of tool and we used that to examine the far side of the pipe, and there it was clear as day. I big break in the pipe we couldn't see from the ladder but with the extendo mirror it was there on the back side of the pipe.

So we called some more plumbers and armed with the exact location of a burst pipe, a worklight and ladder already set up, we were able to get a plumber there and he replaced that section of pipe with pex quickly and easily. We were able to fill more of the system after that and quickly started getting a few working sinks and drains.

One by one we went around opening fixture valves and testing sinks and toilets, checking for supply and drain leaks as we went. Most of the toilet tanks were equipped with pressure-assist flush devices which we were unfamiliar with and a bit frightened by. But we found I think 2 toilets with conventional floats. I don't remember exactly the schedule but I think we quickly had a sink and a toilet working. Then a few days later it was like 3 sinks and 2 toilets.

We found issues with I think 3 overall toilets. One was a conventional one where we had to buy fresh parts for essentially everything except the porcelain as well as a $30 big-azz channel locks just to move one stupid threaded nut like a quarter turn to loosen it enough to move by hand. But we eventually got that one working with no running and no leaks after completely removing the tank and replacing all the gaskets, fill valve, etc. Learned a lot during that one. For example, the RV antifreeze they put in plumbing to winterize it will stain vinyl flooring pink and won't come out. So there's a tip for you.

Two of the pressure assist devices from two different manufacturers seemed to have issues and so I had to research and order replacement parts. I made a mistake on one part which delayed it another week or so to get the actual correct part I needed.

Two of the showers had busted tub faucet fixtures so we bought new ones and replaced them. The only other shower issue was one had a leaky mixing valve plus a leaky drain gasket which we deferred for now as a low priority we could have the plumber address eventually.

By the time we were ready to replace pressure assist parts, Logan was here and we were able to get both of those repaired and working properly with no leaks.

It was great to get so much of the plumbing working ourselves and that all said and done it wasn't a 5-figure expense and really most issues were easy fixes on the water heaters.
