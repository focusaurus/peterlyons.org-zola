Friday sept 10

One project I queued up for this weekend was sanding and painting the exterior steps and ramp. They were all completely worn through the paint down to bare wood in the center portion of each board, and as that wood gets smooth and mossy it gets incredibly slippery. I almost took a header trying to get up the porch steps too quickly on day it was drizzly.

It looked like we might finally have a long enough interval between rain showers to get it done. Jim started going at it with an orbital sander. Not the best tool for the job but we didn't have a belt sander yet and Runnings didn't have any in stock. He sanded the back ramp and the front steps as well as the whole front porch landing and hand rails. Then he set about trying to even up the surfaces with interior drywall spackle. Logan and I both attempted to point out that spackle was for repairing interior walls not exterior stairs but Jim just smiled and nodded and kept at it.

He sanded obsessively Saturday as well including the steel railing which was way more than we needed to work on at this time. By end of day Saturday he still hadn't applied a single brush stroke of paint. Sunday morning I was able to get a belt sander at Wal-Mart but I was keen to conclude the prep work and get paint on there before it rained again. So while Jim was still waking up and getting ready, Stella and I got started painting and got the back ramp done and started on the front porch. Once the paint had been started, Jim seemed to finally acquiesce and he finished painting the remaining steps. I explained that I was primarily looking to solve the slip and fall hazard before the next rain (which would also mess up his spackle if we didn't get it painted in time).

Later in private to Stella, Jim confessed that he had a bit of an OCD episode about the sanding and got up in the middle of the night Saturday night to keep working on it.

But we got it all done Sunday and Monday morning Logan put gripe tape on everything and everything was looking good and no more slip hazard.
