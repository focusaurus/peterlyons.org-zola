My hope and plan was to move by the end of June and use the 3-day weekend of June 18th when I had Friday off for Juneteenth to pack. But the week leading up to that we had more radio silence in response to simple questions about the status of fire suppression, plumbing, electric, and title issues. We set a rough like 48 hour window and figured if we couldn't get any traction, something was deeply wrong and we were going to have to assume the deal might stall out and maybe it would be months before we could move. We heard nothing and so I didn't do any packing that weekend.

On Sunday, we met up with Clarice for lunch at Casa Allegre and talk through our woes with the real estate deal. Why was everything so slow and weird? Why couldn't simple things get done? Were we really going to close? Was someone deliberately sabotaging the deal?

Our overall state was characterized by questions and confusion. We felt like we were paused at a break between a 2-novel set with all questions and no answers. Clarice listened and took all that in before responding. She put us at ease and assured us we weren't going COVID crazy and that the deal still had a sensible core premise. She thought our main roadblock was that we were still remote, and encouraged us to go there so we could be local and deal in person face to face and have boots on the ground to sort out what's what.

So we talked it over a bit and by Tuesday we decided to pack up and move and hope we could salvage the deal once we were local. So Stella hunted down a truck rental which were in short supply and suddenly I had 3 evenings to completely pack my stuff for a cross-country move. Instead of getting to pack on a 3-day weekend off work, now I was trying to get it done after work on Tue/Wed/Thu evenings. Our plan was to pick up the truck Friday morning, load it ,and do our first day of driving on Friday. I was on call at work and arranged to hand off my shift around 10AM Friday morning.

Logan helped us with the truck and we picked one up from Penske in Boulder. After getting it back to Louisville the engine light came on and Logan noticed it was low on DEF (deisel exhaust fluid which I had never heard of) and we ended up needing to return that truck and swap it for a different one in Commerce City, which delayed loading by several hours.

By the time Stella and Logan got back with the second truck, Corey and I had moved pretty much everything from the house to the garage. We then strategically loaded the truck under Logan's supervision. He worked as a driver for FedEx so he's great with all things trucking. My friend Ian stopped by to help for a bit. I think it took us around 3 hours or so to get loaded. We drove the truck and Stella's RAV on this trip and left my van there so we could camp in it for Ian's wedding at the end of July.

With the truck delay we departed later than I'd hoped but it was still plenty early for us to get a full day's drive behind us.

The cross-country trip was relatively easy and fun with 4 drivers. We took turns in different arrangements between the truck and the RAV. To our surprise, roadside lodging was fairly heavily booked and we had some trouble finding accommodations. I think on the second night there was a softball tournament going on and everything in the first town we stopped at was booked solid. So we had to get back on the interstate and do another 20 minutes or so to the next town, but then we found something.

One day we stopped at a small deli and got some great sandwiches plus ice cream from the stand across the street.

We made it to our Airbnb in North Bangor by Sunday evening as planned and were glad to be done driving. The RAV's cruise control doesn't work and we were all a bit out of sorts from so much sitting still and keeping the gas pedal pressed.
