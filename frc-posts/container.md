Monday June 28

I believe at this point we were still holding out hope that maybe the title work would miraculously show up and we'd be able to close by Tuesday and move directly into the property with help from the boys. But Monday came and went with no update and we had to return the rental truck, so we went looking for a storage unit. The few facilities in the area all seemed fully booked, but Stella found a company that would put a shipping container on site for us to use. She got permission from Deacon Brent from the church next door to put the container at the back of their parking lot adjacent to the corner of our property. We still hadn't closed at this point and we weren't entirely confident that we would in fact ever close, so I wasn't comfortable putting the shipping container on the property.

They were able to deliver it quickly and we got stuff out of the truck and into the container pretty quickly. I think less than 2 hours. At this point the plan was for the shipping container to just tide us over a few days until closing. Maybe a week or so at the max since I had stipulated in my "I've had enough of this nonsense" email that we wanted to close no later than Friday June 25. That turned out not to be the case as well see in upcoming posts.
