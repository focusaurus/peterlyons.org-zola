Today we set out to tackle a fairly intimidating project: cleaning the commercial kitchen range. This had not been cleaned before the building was vacated and it was deeply dirty and gross. Greasy, grimy food splatter was everywhere and had congealed into dark brown shiny residue on every surface and in every nook and cranny.

We started initially working at it with soap and water working directly on the stove in place. I eventually noticed some bolts holding the eye-height shelf in place and was able to remove that piece. It came off as one big piece of formed stainless steel and although it was still unweildy because it is so large, we were able to get it over to the commercial sink and work on it from a much better position.

I was delighted to discover that the stove was designed to be disassembled for deep cleaning somewhat regularly and was able to get many stainless steel pieces off for cleaning: all the trim pieces, the oven doors, and the toe kicks. We realized the griddle plate itself was removable as well but it was really heavy. It's about a 2'x2' block of solid stainless steel about 1/4" thick and it's gotta weigh 80 pounds or so. There's a grease chute welded to the bottom at an angle that extends down a foot or so and makes it awkward to lift. But we eventually got it up high enough to clear the grease chute out of its housing and get it removed. Once we set it on the floor it was much easier for me to go at it with a heavy duty paint scraper and remove the thick syrupy brown residue buildup.

We weren't able to fully dissassemble it though. The cast iron parts that plumb the fuel looked potentially fragile to me so we didn't take those out in the first session. There's also a grease catcher drawer that would normally pull straight out but it was locked in place by cooled grease and wouldn't budge. At this point the propane was not yet turned on so we couldn't get anything heated up to loosen the grease.

By the end of that first day, the stove was a gleaming, sparkling beauty. Stainless steel is a miracle material.

A few days later after Jim had arrived, he showed us how to take all the cast iron burners and piping out so we could clean that. He grew up around restaurants and worked in commercial kitchens for years so he was a big help with that.

On September 2 a tech from Adirondack Propane came to check and service the 3 propane tanks on the property and was able to show us how to turn the propane on, light the pilot lights, and get the stove going. That night Logan made some pancakes and hash for the innaugural meal.
